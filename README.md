# BookOrganizer-Typescript-API-PoC

This project is an study on Typescript(TS), creating an basic CRUD in a Postgres API. To show my studies I decided do make an Book Organizer that can save users books and indicates some statistics about it.

# About 

This project had the purpose to show that I learned how to:

- Configure an basic setup of an API with TS;
- Understand how some @types works and how some dependencies works with it;
- Make an CRUD using TS needs without using "Any" type;
- Understand difference between time of compilation and time of excecution;

Routes: 
```bash

GET: /books
Returning: List of all books that you have on database;

POST: /books
Body: { "bookTitle": "Book Title Exemple", "pages": 200, "status": "N達o iniciado" }
obs: -pages must be a number;
     -status must be one of this strings: 'N達o iniciado' | 'Em andamento' | 'Livro lido'.
     
PUT: /books/:id
Body: { "status": "N達o iniciado" }
obs: -status must be one of this strings: 'N達o iniciado' | 'Em andamento' | 'Livro lido'.

DELETE: /books/delete/:id

GET: /pagesRead
Returning: A string with how many pages you have read on your finished books;

GET: /booksRead
Returning: A string with how many books you have finished;

```
