# BookOrganizer-Typescript-API-PoC

This project is an study on Jest tests, creating basic tests in an existing CRUD. To show my studies I decided to update my Book Organizer that can save users books and indicates some statistics about it.

# About 

This project had the purpose to show that I learned how to:

- Configure an basic setup of Jest;
- Understand how expect some errors and how tests are supposed to show them;
- Test the existing CRUD using Jest and supertest;

Routes: 
```bash

GET: /books
Returning: List of all books that you have on database;

POST: /books
Body: { "bookTitle": "Book Title Exemple", "pages": 200, "status": "N達o iniciado" }
obs: -pages must be a number;
     -status must be one of this strings: 'N達o iniciado' | 'Em andamento' | 'Livro lido'.
     
PUT: /books/:id
Body: { "status": "N達o iniciado" }
obs: -status must be one of this strings: 'N達o iniciado' | 'Em andamento' | 'Livro lido'.

DELETE: /books/delete/:id
